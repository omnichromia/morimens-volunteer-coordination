# Morimens Localization Team Hub



# WORK IN PROGRESS, Don't use this until this notice goes away <3



My hope here is to have a single active hub for all work being done in the Morimens Localization Project.
I'm gonna start by chunking apart the Source Sheets into organized sections as different files, so that work can be neatly coordinated, and so that it's simpler to upload work to the main BIAV Repo without errors along the way.





#### My initial thoughts for this:

I'd like to have a public repo any of us can push to. I'd have the source sheets cut up into manageable chunks and separated into their own folders, and each folder would have a text file that lists who's working on that chunk in which language;



when someone picks up a task, they download it and sign their name on that file. that way we wouldn't have multiple people working on the same files in the same language at the same time, contribution credits will be more clear, and it'll be easier to know what does and doesn't need work done.



when they're done, they would upload JUST the "Key" column and the column for their language, and I would confirm and commit that into the base file, for the next person to download and work on; and when Ace is ready to upload our work to BIAV, I can wrap everything that's been changed into a single organized file and save Ace all that work.
