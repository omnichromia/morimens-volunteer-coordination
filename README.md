# Morimens Localization Team Hub

is not rdy yet :p

This is an alternative, more organized way to contribute to the BIAV Localization project. PUSH access is invite-only for now, so message me here or on Discord (@omnichromia), or post an [Issue](https://github.com/omnichromia/morimens-volunteer-coordination/issues), or contribute via pull request and I'll add you as a contributor! 

I'll do my best to cut up and sort out the BIAV Source Sheets into manageable chunks, and that may take a while, but I'll update the repo with my progress regularly. If there are any issues like missing or misplaced lines, ping me in the Discord! (@omnichromia)

You're of course still welcome to use the BIAV repo's fork-and-pull system; I'll do my best to keep my files up-to-date with compiled pulls from the main repo.

I'll compile all of the contributions made here whenever significant progress has been made and make sure everyone gets credited properly!


## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:

1. Navigate to the file you want to work on and download the **MAIN** file.
2. Open the LEDGER in that folder, and write your DISCORD USERNAME on the same line as the header for the language you're contributing;
3. If that header is already taken, please work on a different file.
4. Do your thing! When you're ready, save the file as .xlsx (or UTF-8 .csv).
> Don't worry about what the file looks like. As long as it contains the unmodified KEY column, you can include or exclude anything else.
> Deleting rows is fine as well. **All I need is KEY and your contributions.**
6. **RENAME your file**, so that it's not exactly the same as the file you started with. Specifics don't matter.
7. Upload your file to the same exact folder you downloaded the original from, and I'll handle the rest!



## PLEASE DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES OTHER THAN LEDGERS. Thank you!
