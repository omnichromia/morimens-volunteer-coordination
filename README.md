# Morimens Localization Team Hub

My hope here is to have a single active hub for all work being done in the Morimens Localization Project.
I'm gonna start by chunking apart the Source Sheets into organized sections as different files, so that work can be neatly coordinated, and so that it's simpler to upload work to the main BIAV Repo without errors along the way.
