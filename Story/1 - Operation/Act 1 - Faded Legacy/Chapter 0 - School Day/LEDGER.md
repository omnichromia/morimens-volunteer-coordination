# LEDGER



This is the ledger for the file(s) found in this folder.

If you download a file from this folder with intent to edit, write your Discord handle down next to the language you're going to work on.

If there's already a name there, please choose something else to do, as someone else is already working on this file in that language.

This is to ensure that:

1. We don't have multiple people working on the same file in the same language at the same time;
2. Everyone gets properly credited with what work they've done where; and
3. We can keep track of what has and hasn't been done yet.

When your work has been compiled into the main file, your contribution will be listed UNDERNEATH the main header for that language, freeing up the header for the next volunteer.

Thanks!
